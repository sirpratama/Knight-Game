# Knight Game

A 2D adventure game created with Godot Engine v4.3.

## Overview

Knight Game is my first project built with Godot Engine v4.3. This game follows a knight character on an adventure through various environments, utilizing pathfinding for enemy AI and interactive tile-based levels.

## Features

- **Character Control**: Play as a knight with smooth movement controls
- **Enemy AI**: Enemies utilize NavigationArea and pathfinding for intelligent pursuit
- **Layered TileMaps**: Multiple tile layers create depth and environment variety
- **Animated Sprites**: Character animations implemented using SpriteSheets
- **Dynamic Environments**: Interactive objects and obstacles

## Technologies Used

- **Godot Engine v4.3**
- **GDScript**
- **Sprite Animation**
- **NavigationArea and Pathfinding**
- **TileMap Layers**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Godot Engine v4.3 or higher

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sirpratama/Knight-Game.git

## Development Journey

This project represents my first steps into game development with Godot. I focused on learning:

- How to implement character movement and animation
- Working with SpriteSheets for efficient animations
- Creating environments using TileMaps and multiple layers
- Implementing basic enemy AI with pathfinding
- Managing NPC Interaction

## Future Plans

- [ ] Add more enemy types such as bosses
- [ ] Implement inventory system
- [ ] Create additional levels
- [ ] Add sound effects
- [ ] Implement saving/loading game progress
